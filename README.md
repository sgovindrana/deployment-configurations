# Food Delivery Application

**Food Delivery Application** is a full-stack application built using **Microservices Architecture**. It allows users to browse restaurants and menus, add multiple items to the food catalogue cart, and place food orders, receiving a successful order confirmation dialogue. The application is developed using modern technologies and deployed on AWS for enhanced scalability and reliability.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**:  
  - **Angular 16**, **TypeScript**,  **Javacript**, **HTML5**, **CSS3**
  
- **Backend**:  
  - **Java 17**, **Spring Boot**, **Microservices**, **Hibernate**, **Junit Test Case (Code Coverage > 80%)**
  
- **Databases**:  
  - **MySQL (RDS)**, **MongoDB (Atlas, MongoCompass)**
  
- **CI/CD**:  
  - **Jenkins** (Continuous Integration), **SonarQube** (Code Quality), **ArgoCD** (Continuous Deployment)
  
- **Containerization & Orchestration**:  
  - **Docker**, **Kubernetes (AWS EKS on EC2)**

- **Cloud**:  
  - **AWS (IAM, EC2, RDS, EKS)**

## Components

### Frontend

The **Frontend** component is built using **Angular**, **TypeScript** & **JavaScript** providing an interactive user interface for:
[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/sgovindrana/food-delivery-application-fe)

- Browse restaurants and view menus to explore food options.
- Add multiple items to the food catalogue cart for easy order management.
- Place an order and receive a successful order confirmation dialogue upon completion.

### Backend

The **Backend** consists of several **Microservices** developed using **Java Spring Boot**, including:

- **Eureka Service**: Service registry & discovery. [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/sgovindrana/eureka-service)  
- **Food Catalogue Service**: Manages food items & restaurant info. [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/sgovindrana/food-catalogue-microservice)  
- **Order Service**: Handles order placement, status updates & saves orders in MongoDB. [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/sgovindrana/order-microservice)  
- **User Service**: Manages user profiles and supports adding food items to the user’s cart. [GitHub Repo] [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/sgovindrana/userinfo-microservice)  
- **Restaurant Listing Service**: Manages restaurant data & listing details. [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/sgovindrana/restaurant-listing-microservice)  
  
### Microservices & Deployment

The application is designed with **Microservices Architecture** and deployed on **AWS Kubernetes (EKS)**, ensuring scalability and high availability. 

- **Eureka Service** for service discovery and registration.
- **Docker** is used for containerizing microservices.
- **Jenkins** is used for the **CI pipeline** to automate the build and test process.
- **ArgoCD** is used for **CD** to automate the deployment of the microservices on AWS.

## Deployment & Configuration
- **Deployment Configurations**: Orchestrates end-to-end CI/CD—on each code push, Jenkins runs the build, increments the app version, builds & pushes new Docker images to ECR, commits updated Kubernetes manifests (with the new image tag) into this repo, and ArgoCD continuously monitors and syncs these changes to AWS EKS. [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/sgovindrana/deployment-configurations)

### Deployment Flow:
1. **Microservices** are developed and containerized using **Docker**.
2. **Jenkins** runs the CI pipeline for building, testing, and analyzing code quality.
3. **ArgoCD** automates the deployment of services on **AWS EKS**.
4. Services are registered on **Eureka** for efficient inter-service communication.
