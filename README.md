**Food Delivery Application** is a full-stack application built using **Microservices Architecture**. It allows users to browse restaurants, place food orders, and manage deliveries. The application is developed with modern technologies and deployed on AWS for scalability and reliability.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**:  
  - **Angular 16**, **TypeScript**,  **Javacript**, **HTML5**, **CSS3**
  
- **Backend**:  
  - **Java 17**, **Spring Boot**, **Microservices**, **Hibernate**
  
- **Databases**:  
  - **MySQL (RDS)**, **MongoDB (Atlas, MongoCompass)**
  
- **CI/CD**:  
  - **Jenkins** (Continuous Integration), **SonarQube** (Code Quality), **ArgoCD** (Continuous Deployment)
  
- **Containerization & Orchestration**:  
  - **Docker**, **Kubernetes (AWS EKS on EC2)**

- **Cloud**:  
  - **AWS (IAM, EC2, RDS, EKS)**

## Components

### Frontend

The **Frontend** component is built using **Angular**, **TypeScript** & **JavaScript** providing an interactive user interface for:

- Browsing restaurants and menus.
- Placing and tracking orders.
- Managing user profiles and payment methods.

### Backend

The **Backend** consists of several **Microservices** developed using **Java Spring Boot**, including:

- **Food Catalogue Service**: Manages food items and restaurant information.
- **Order Service**: Handles order placements, status updates, and delivery tracking.
- **User Service**: Manages user profiles, authentication, and authorization.
- **Restaurant Listing Service**: Manages restaurant data, including listing details and search functionality.

### Microservices & Deployment

The application is designed with **Microservices Architecture** and deployed on **AWS Kubernetes (EKS)**, ensuring scalability and high availability. 

- **Eureka Service** for service discovery and registration.
- **Docker** is used for containerizing microservices.
- **Jenkins** is used for the **CI pipeline** to automate the build and test process.
- **ArgoCD** is used for **CD** to automate the deployment of the microservices on AWS.

## Deployment & Configuration

The application is deployed using **AWS EKS** and uses **Eureka** for service discovery. For detailed deployment steps, refer to the [Deployment Configuration Guide](insert-deployment-config-link-here).

### Deployment Flow:
1. **Microservices** are developed and containerized using **Docker**.
2. **Jenkins** runs the CI pipeline for building, testing, and analyzing code quality.
3. **ArgoCD** automates the deployment of services on **AWS EKS**.
4. Services are registered on **Eureka** for efficient inter-service communication.
